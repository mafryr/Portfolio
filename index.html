      <p> I’m Colombian by blood, born and raised in Colombia.  I was 18 years old when I migrated to the United States as an exchange student. I attended university in San Francisco, California. I obtained a BS degree in Economics.  </p>

      <p>I love traveling to different countries. ravel is many things to different people. For some, travel might just be a fun adventure, or a chance to visit friends and family.  For others, it might be about stepping out of comfort zones and embarking on a new journey.  </p>

      <p>I love music, books and chess. I was a national chess champion back in Colombia when I was 11 years old. I stopped playing here because I did not find that many people that play chess. I work for Astronics Test Sytems in the Finance department. Astronics Test Systems ensures optimal performance of mission critical systems through innovative test solutions. The company offers automatic test expertise to electronics manufacturers in the aerospace, military, mass transit, medical, and space industries. In short, they provide test solutions that ensure the world’s most advanced electronic products perform as designed, every time. </p>
